# Titanium NavigationWindow Example

*This is a working example based on the Titanium DOC found [here]:(http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#!/api/Titanium.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow)*


Titanium.Proxy > Titanium.UI.View > Titanium.UI.Window > Titanium.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow
A Navigation Window implements a specialized view that manages the navigation of hierarchical content.

The navigation window is created with the method Titanium.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow.

The window property must be set initially in the constructor when creating a navigation window to the root level window. All navigation windows must have at least one root window that cannot be removed.

This class replaces the Titanium.UI.iPhone.NavigationGroup class. Please note that this object is a window and is supposed to be used as a top level container. This can not be added to other windows.
